# EasyViewer

## Description

EasyViewer is an application that allows you to download videos and/or audio from YouTube videos.

The user enters the URL of the video and selects the location to save the file.

The app offers two buttons: Download Video and Download Audio.

While the file is downloading, a progress bar is displayed.

## Requirements

### Python Version

The app has been developed and tested on Python 3.11, although it may work with older versions.

However, I can't guarantee full app functionality on Python versions prior to 3.11.

If you're having trouble running your app on an older version of Python, upgrade to version 3.11 or higher to ensure that everything works correctly.

To download the latest version of Python, visit the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads).

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11 or higher
- python-dotenv (Environment variable for language switching)
- pandas (Read the Excel file for game texts)
- openpyxl (Dependence on "pandas" to read the Excel file of the app's texts)
- flet (Graphical interface)
- pytubefix (To download the video/audio of the YouTube video)
- requests (Checking if the user has internet)

To install the dependencies run this command with the virtual environment enabled:

```bash
uv sync
```
