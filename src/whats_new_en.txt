New feature

- You've now got the ability to download multiple videos at once.

How to use it?

- Just put the URLs underneath each other and click on download.

Fixed

- That's fixed an issue that previously blocked the download if you deleted a folder you had previously selected.
- Now you can delete folders and download your videos/audios without worrying.
