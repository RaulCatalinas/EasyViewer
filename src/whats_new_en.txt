New feature

You can now download multiple videos at once.

How do I use it?

Just put the URLs underneath each other and click on download the video or audio.

Fixed

We've fixed an issue that previously blocked the download if you deleted a folder you had previously selected.

Now you can delete folders and download your files without worrying.
